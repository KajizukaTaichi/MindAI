# MindAI

Brain AI is a simple Rust-based project that simulates a basic psychological model to interact and respond to user input.

## Overview

This AI attempts to replicate a basic psychological model by maintaining a memory of words, associated meanings, and emotions. It uses this stored information to respond to user input with predefined emotional reactions based on recognized words and their meanings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, follow the official installation guide at [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/brain_ai.git
cd brain_ai
```

### Usage

Run the program:

```bash
cargo run
```

Once the program is running, the AI will prompt you for input. Try typing in different words or phrases to see how the AI responds based on its stored memory and emotions.

### Customization

The AI's behavior can be customized by modifying the memory stored in the code. You can add new words, their meanings, and associated emotions by editing the `Brain` struct's `memory` field in the `main.rs` file.
